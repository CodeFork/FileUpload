Very simple file upload and download ASP.NET Core application.

## Developer notes

Some notes to make development, build and publish easier.

### Publish to Raspberry

```
dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-arm
```

### Make ASP.NET Core application a service on Raspberry linux

Create a file at `/lib/systemd/system/{service_name}` and taste a content:

```
[Unit]
Description={description} ASP.NET CORE app
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/wwwroot/{path_to_executable}
Restart=on-abort

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

After every publish and copy to server, you need to make executable executable:

```
chmod +x {path_to_executable}
```
